This is Codelet, a flashcard web app designed specifically for studying
code.

This app uses Flask with Python and Jinja to create webpages.

Use the command "flask run" to initiate a session on your server.

SQL databases will populate automatically - you can access them in
terminal with "sqlite3 codelet.db".
